# Pool Hall Management Software

This is a DOS program written by my grandfather in the 1980s (I think).

I have no idea how it works, what it actually does, or how to install it.

He told me that he was proud of what he wrote here because it contains some
sort of custom window manager.  There are some different screens that this 
program contains, and there is some window management layer that allows all 
the data needed for these windows to be displayed in a very small amount of 
memory at the same time.

Happy birthday, Grandad.
